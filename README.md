## Repository Organization

Each project folder may contain the following files:

```Project_Name```
- data &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <- &nbsp; folder; raw data used in the project 

- models &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <- &nbsp; folder; trained and pre-trained models

- reports &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <- &nbsp; folder; analyses generated during project development

- images &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; <- &nbsp; folder; images used in the notebook file

- utils &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &ensp; &nbsp; <- &nbsp; python file; contains usable functions to the project
